                <p>
                  Welcome to my website! My name is Ashtan Mistal, and I am currently a double major in Physics and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
                  I am also a teaching assistant for the <a href="https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/team.html">Computer Science 110 course at UBC</a>, an introductory course on systematic program design.
                  Outside of this, I am a residence advisor on campus, where I support residents in their academic and personal development through a variety of programs and events and peer-to-peer support.

                  <br><br>
                  I'm currently looking for a full-time position in software development starting in January 2024, and I'm open to relocation.
                  If you'd like to get in touch, the best place to reach me is at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtanmistal/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">About Me and My Studies</h3>

              <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                <p>
                  Throughout my studies, I have developed a passion for computer graphics and computer vision, and this has helped shape some of my personal projects (see Projects tab on this page).

                  Connection and interaction with the real world is what drives these interests.
                  Both of these allow for greater integration and connection between the virtual and real worlds, and I am excited to see where this will go in the future - Not only with the direct application of computer vision as applied to VR/AR, but also in the realm of scientific research and discovery.

                  I'm also particularly interested in developing methods to simulate real-world phenomena in a virtual environment in real-time, in order to enable immersive and interactive experiences that would otherwise be impossible. Currently, for example, I'm developing a machine learning model to create accurate sound reverberations based on a 3D model of a room, through a learned image-source model approximation.
                  <!-- TODO actually start this project and add at least *something* to the github repo.-->
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                  Taking a combination of both Physics and Computer Science has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in both fields and also begin to understand the slice of knowledge that is the intersection between the two.
                  I believe this intersection is where some of the most exciting and impactful research is being done.
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                  In my spare time, I enjoy Tae Kwon Do, music production, digital art, mountain biking, hiking, and thrifting. <!-- Expand on this.-->
                  Music production especially has been a great way to both express creativity and learn more technical skills surrounding acoustics and sound design, and is part of what inspired me to pursue my current project.
                  Vancouver provides the perfect backdrop for all of these activities, and I am always looking for new ways to get outside and experience the city and the surrounding area.
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                  I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am looking forward to seeing where this journey takes me.
                  If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me through my social media links, whether you have any questions about the website material, or just want to chat.
                  I'd be happy to answer questions if you're interested in any of the topics I've covered, or if you're interested in learning more about my experiences.

                  The UBC Minecraft Project is a project that aims to recreate the entire UBC Vancouver Campus inside a Minecraft world, in a 1:1 scale.
                  It's built by transforming the <a href="https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/lidar-2022/information/"> City of Vancouver's LiDAR data</a> into a Minecraft world using a custom Python transformation script, and then using various machine learning methods to add some more detail to the world. After, the server will be made public for folks to explore and help build the building interiors. See the GitHub page for the current progress, screenshots, and renders.
                  The project is a collaboration with the UBC Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society.

                  A web application designed during winter break that allows users to create and edit notes using Markdown syntax.
                  The UI is designed for ease of use and efficiency, inspired by the layout of the note-taking app Google Keep.
                  The Markdown syntax allows for more complex formatting than a simple text editor, and the application is designed to be as lightweight, allowing for quick and easy note-taking.
                  It also enables the user to input LaTeX math equations, which are rendered live using katex.
                  The user can export notes as either Markdown or LaTeX files.
                  The UI is built using Angular using Material Design components, and the backend is built in Typescript using Node.js.
                  The project is intended to be a useful tool for taking notes and writing documents in a STEM academic environment.

                  This website is the culmination of my PHYS 420 project, which is a series of hands-on and virtual demonstrations intended to teach secondary school students the basics of shading in computer graphics, and provide a theoretical basis for ray tracing.
                  It is accompanied by a ~45 minute presentation that covers the basics of shading, and some theory behind ray tracing as applicable to students with no prior knowledge of computer science.
                  Virtual demonstrations are hosted on the website and are coded in WebGL, and hands-on demonstrations recreated the environment in real life, utilizing light to visualize the "ideal" shading of a surface.

                  Designed and built a monophonic synthesizer using the MSP 430 microprocessor as part of a laboratory course in electronics, PHYS 319.
                  Utilized knowledge of digital electronics, microcontrollers, and audio synthesis techniques to implement the synthesizer, and created custom firmware for the MSP 430 to generate and manipulate audio signals in real-time.
                  Developed understanding of circuitry, microcontroller programming, and audio synthesis techniques, and their applications.
                  Built a button-based user interface using a breadboard to control the synthesizer.
                  Built as part of the PHYS 319 course at UBC.

                  Rexfro (Regex Find and Replace Operator) is a Java Swing application that enables the user to perform an arbitrary number of different regex find-and-replace operations on multiple plain text documents at once, accelerating document conversion and translation in a user-friendly layout.
                  This enables a much more efficient workflow for certain repetitive tasks that regular expressions are well-suited for, and enabling sequential find-and-replace operations to be performed in a single pass provides an extra dimension of workflow efficiency.
                  Designed and implemented the user interface using Java Swing, and wrote the core functionality in Java.
                  Built for the CPSC 210 course at UBC.
